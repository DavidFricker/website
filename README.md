# Personal Website

The source code of my personal website. The website uses an opensource [terminal theme](https://term.m4tt72.com) to add a bit of fun to a boring website.

## Development

### Using npm

0. Update content by editing the [commands.ts](src/utils/commands.ts) file.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
